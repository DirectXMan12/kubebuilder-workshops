# KubeBuilder Workshops

This repository contains a workshop for building operators with
KubeBuilder.  The workshop follows along with the [GKE guestbook
tutorial](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/guestbook).

If you're here from KubeCon EU (Barcelona) 2019, you've come to the right
place.  The corresponding slides can be found at

# Starting Out

Each commit contains progressively more details on building the workshop.
Take a look at the commit messages, and then start from the `start` tag
with

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/directxman12/kubebuilder-workshops --branch start
```

or (from within the repository)

```bash
$ git checkout start
```

You can also start at HEAD, but that spoils the fun :-).
