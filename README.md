# KubeBuilder Workshops

This repository contains a series of similar workshops for building
operators with KubeBuilder.

Each workshop lives on a different branch:

## Branches

- [kubecon-eu-2019](https://github.com/DirectXMan12/kubebuilder-workshops/tree/kubecon-eu-2019):
  
  * **Level**: Intermediate
  * **Topic**: Write an operator that deploys and manages the standard
    Kubernetes GuestBook application.  Contains associated slides for
    "freeform" implementation, plus suggested implementation details as
    commits.

- [software-architecture-2019](https://github.com/DirectXMan12/kubebuilder-workshops/tree/software-architecture-2019)
  
  * **Level**: Basic
  * **Topic**: Write an operator that deploys and manages MongoDB.
    Contains step-by-step in-repository instructions without focusing too
    much on the underlying MongoDB mechanics.

- [kubecon-us-2019](https://github.com/DirectXMan12/kubebuilder-workshops/tree/kubecon-us-2019):
  
  * **Level**: Intermediate
  * **Topic**: Write an operator that deploys and manages the standard
    Kubernetes GuestBook application, but focusing on new extensibility
    features, like declarative defaulting a server-side apply.  Contains
    associated slides and suggested implementation steps.
